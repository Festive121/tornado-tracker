<h1>Tornado Tracker</h1>
<p>This is a command line program that sources the National Weather Service API to find tornadoes across the US.</p>
<p>Eventually this will be integrated into a live map that shows tornadoes and their path.</p>
<p>Hopefully in the future, this can be used for an easy storm chasing interface.</p>
